Hello! I'm a beginner developer creating Minecraft ports. I'm just starting out, so please don't be too critical.

I wanted to give a huge shoutout to my friends: SnowSans098, VladNaliv, Uno228, N.Software, and Mezoik!


This project is still pretty new, so I'm putting a lot of work into it. I recently rebuilt Minecraft 4k Web, and now it's almost exactly like the original, but instead of a JavaApplet, it's implemented in JavaScript and HTML.


I'd really appreciate it if you could tell your friends and acquaintances about my project!
